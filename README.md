# neural-network
Everything related to the neural networks I really need to explore

Launch **nn.py** to see XOR problem solved by a Neural Network:
```
python3 nn.py
```
*Gradient Descent* calculations are in **photos/** folder

For activation function I used *Sigmoid* (NOT **ReLU**).  
Error function is called *Mean Squared loss function*.
